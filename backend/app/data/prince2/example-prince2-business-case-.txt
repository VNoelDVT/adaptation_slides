1.  Purpose  
 
1.1   To document the justification for undertaking ILX Project Management, based on the estimated cost of 
implementation and taking account of the risks and anticipated business benefits and savings to be gained.  
1.2   To request autho risation to progress to initiation of the project with provisional allocation of resources for the full 
project  
1.3.  To request release of £20,000 in the current financial year to undertake the first stage of this project.  
 
 
2. Background  
 
2.1   The Offi ce of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has set local authorities challenging targets for organisational and 
technical change, allocating substantial funding to assist in making effective use of technology to improve services.  
2.2   ILX identified the need for a substantial programme of change to improve services by using technology. The ILX 
programme of courses was instigated to deliver change.  
2.3   There is currently no standard project management methodology in use in various councils. Many of the staff acting 
as project managers for projects have no training in project management and many of the decision makers have no 
training in directing projects or programmes. There is, however, a ‘co -ordination group’ which oversees project 
delivery through a quarte rly ‘project management workshop’ as well as ad hoc response to requests for direction.  
2.4   Within some councils, there is a separate Projects Team within the Property & Projects service area which provides 
a project delivery service.  
2.5   The project m anager for this project has developed a separate discussion paper proposing adoption of a corporate 
approach to project delivery. Other service areas including Property & Projects, Human Resources and Performance 
Management have received copies of this pap er and will be invited to contribute to tailoring a methodology and 
developing a management framework which makes best use of existing procedures.  
2.6   PRINCE2 (PRojects in a Controlled Environment) is a standard proj ect management tool. It is widely used by public 
and private sector organisations and many other public and private sector agencies.  
 
 
3.  Reasons  
 
3.1   To maximise likelihood of successful delivery of individual projects through the ILX programme of cou rses  
3.2.  To ensure controlled and appropriate use of resources available  
3.3   To improve project delivery through lessons learned in monitoring costs and evaluating benefits delivered  
 
 
4.  Options  
 
4.1   Option 1  – Continue with existing project mana gement methods and framework  
4.2   Option 2  – Adopt PRINCE2 project management methodology from ILX and develop an appropriate framework to 
support its use  
4.3   Option 3  – Adopt alternative project management methodology and framework

5.  Bene fits 
 
5.1  Option 1  – Continue with existing project management methods and framework  
 This option will require least initial effort and cost  
5.2   Option 2 – Adopt tailored PRINCE2 methodology and framework  
 Facilitates proper prioritisation and planning o f projects in line with resources available to the programme  
 Reduction in likelihood of waste of resources due to lack of coherent direction.  
 Provides a clear audit trail of decisions made and demonstrates due diligence in allocation of finances  
 Improved e ffectiveness in control of budget – budget released only when likely costs and benefits have been 
identified  
 Clear expectations of products set out before initiation of each project, promoting better conformance of 
delivered products with user requirements  and expectations  
 Effective monitoring of progress so that support and direction can be offered in a timely fashion when required, 
providing time to implement solutions to problems  
 Effective monitoring of risk so that problems can be pre -empted or continge ncies put in place  
 Increase in productivity arising from a common understanding of processes  
 Improved communication and joint working with the many public and private sector organisations which have 
adopted PRINCE2  
5.3   Option 3  – Adopt alternative projec t management methodology  
 This option offers the same benefits as option 2, except that it would be unlikely to be known to most of the 
organisations  
 We would not share a common vocabulary with which to communicate when working on projects together  
 This opt ion builds on existing expertise in this methodology within the Property & Projects service area  
 
 
 
6.  Risks

6.2  Option 2 – Adopt tailored PRINCE2 project management methodology  
 
R isk  Pro bab ility  Impa ct  M itig ation  
Senior  decision  makers  
resist  change Low High  Ensure  effective  sharing  of expected  benefits,  plans  and 
progress  immediately  and throughout  project  
Project  Managers  resist  
change  Medium  High  Ensure  effective  training  and support  for project  managers  
and provide  sufficient  time  for them to undertake  their 
duties – this may require  employment  of additional  staff  
PRINCE2  not adopted  
corporately  leading  to lack of 
common  understanding  of 
vocabulary  and procedures  
for introducing  change  High  High  Work  closely  with other  areas  as the project  progresses  – 
involve  other  areas  in decisions  about  tailoring  Prince2.  
Identify  organisational  PRINCE2  champion  with wider  
remit  to promote  uptake  with ILX 
 
 
 
6.3  Option  3 – Adopt alternative project management methodology  
 
R isk  Pro bab ility  Impa ct  M itig atio n 
Same  as Option  2    
Difficulties  in joint  working  
with regional,  national  and 
local partners, suppliers etc  High  High  Difficult  to mitigate  as most  other  organisations  will not - it is 
much  easier  for us to conform with the majority  choice  
– ie PRINCE2 . 
 
 
 
7. Costs  
 
7.1   Option 1  – Continue with existing project management methods and framework  
 There are no direct costs for this option. The cost to the organisation are likely to be in waste of resources in 
projects which are likely to be delivered ov er budget and late and are less likely to deliver benefits or achieve 
targets.

8.1   The ODPM will be allocating £500,000 to ILX for 2012/13 and this is likely to be subject to appropriate local plans 
for implementation of the national e -government targets. A further £300,000 will be allocated for 2012/13.  
8.2   Alongside corporate change management and business process re -engineering, effective project management is 
fundamental to bringing worthwhile and lasting change to this organisation. Placing trained Project Managers 
within an effective and supportive fr amework greatly reduces the risks that investment will be mismanaged and the 
opportunity to deliver significant benefits will be missed.  
8.3   The estimated amount required to put in place one of the foundation stones of successful realisation of e -
governm ent benefits equates to approximately 5% of the investment to be managed. It is the opinion of the project 
manager that the likelihood of wasting far more than that is high in the absence of an appropriate project 
management methodology and framework.  
8.4   Option 2, adoption of PRINCE2 is a better long term choice than option 3, adoption of an alternative methodology, 
because of the need to work with other organisations who are most likely to use PRINCE2. Communication and 
planning with these organisations  will be greatly eased by use of PRINCE2 vocabulary and documents.  
 
 
 
9.  Recommendation  
 
9.1 It is recommended that the option selected is:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10. Timescales  
 
10.1   An outline plan is included here. A more detailed plan is available as a separate document.  
 
2012  Feb  M ar  Ap r  M ay  Ju n  Ju l Aug  Sept  O ct 
Sta ge 1 - Initiation           
Sta ge 2 - Pre-implementation           
Sta ge 3 - Implementation           
 
 
 
11. Request for Authorisation of Stage 1 Funding  
 
11.1  The project manager requests  
 Authorisa tion to progress to initiation of the project with provisional allocation of finances for the full project  
 £24,000 be made available in the current financial year to undertake Stage 1  O ptio n 2 – Adopt PRINCE2 project management met hodology from ILX and put in place a n appropriate 
project management framework
